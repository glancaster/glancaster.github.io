        <h1>Thesis on Optimized Bistable Laminates</h1>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This article highlights the details of my Master's Thesis on Bistable Laminates.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>During my time in Graduate School at Clemson University, I had the
opportunity to write a thesis in an area of focus. My area of focus
was on Composite Materials which is a combination of materials to make
an optimized material. More specifically, I dealt with Bistable
Laminates which comprise of layers of composite materials.</p>
<p>My Thesis was on <em>An Application of Optimized Bistable Laminates as a
Low Velocity, Low Impact Mechanical Deterrent</em>.</p>
<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>This research considers the problem of using bistable laminates as a
mechanical deterrent to the impending impact of a particle. The
structure will be controlled through an algorithm that will utilize
piezoelectric devices to activate them in unison with the bistable
laminate to successfully deter. A novel experimental setup will be
constructed to ensure that the bistable laminate stays fixed when
acting as a mechanical deterrent.</p>
