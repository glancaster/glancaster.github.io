# Thesis on Optimized Bistable Laminates

# Description

This article highlights the details of my Master's Thesis on Bistable Laminates.

# Introduction

During my time in Graduate School at Clemson University, I had the
opportunity to write a thesis in an area of focus. My area of focus
was on Composite Materials which is a combination of materials to make
an optimized material. More specifically, I dealt with Bistable
Laminates which comprise of layers of composite materials.

My Thesis was on *An Application of Optimized Bistable Laminates as a
Low Velocity, Low Impact Mechanical Deterrent*.

## Abstract:
This research considers the problem of using bistable laminates as a
mechanical deterrent to the impending impact of a particle. The
structure will be controlled through an algorithm that will utilize
piezoelectric devices to activate them in unison with the bistable
laminate to successfully deter. A novel experimental setup will be
constructed to ensure that the bistable laminate stays fixed when
acting as a mechanical deterrent.
