# Hey, I'm Graham

I'm a mechanical engineer, outdoor ethusiast, and go-getter from
upstate South Carolina. I enjoy creating new ideas, learning new
skills, and building anything mechanical or programmable. if i'm not
behind my computer, you'll find me outside hiking, camping, or
sailing. I recently graduated from Clemson University with my Master's
in Mechanical Engineering and actively seeking opportunites in the
realm of materials, mechanical design, and programming.
