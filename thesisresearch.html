        <h1>Thesis Research</h1>

        <p>
          During my time in Graduate School at Clemson University, I had the
          opportunity to write a thesis in an area of focus. My area of focus
          was on Composite Materials which is a combination of materials to make
          an optimized material. More specifically, I dealt with Bistable
          Laminates which comprise of layers of composite materials.
          <br />
          My Thesis was on An Application of Optimized Bistable Laminates as a
          Low Velocity, Low Impact Mechanical Deterrent
          <br />
          Abstract:
          <br />
          This research considers the problem of using bistable laminates as a
          mechanical deterrent to the impending impact of a particle. The
          structure will be controlled through an algorithm that will utilize
          piezoelectric devices to activate them in unison with the bistable
          laminate to successfully deter. A novel experimental setup will be
          constructed to ensure that the bistable laminate stays fixed when
          acting as a mechanical deterrent.

          Before we get into the content of this unique application, I am going
          to break down the building blocks that we are going to use to get
          there.
          <br />
          Smart Materials and Shape Morphing Structures
          <br />
          To start us off, the structure used in this application can be broken
          down into two areas: smart materials and shape morphing structures.
          Smart materials have the ability to couple between various physical
          domains. An example of this used in this research are piezoelectric
          materials which have the ability to go between the electrical and
          mechanical domains. Next, is shape morphing structures which change
          shape without external tools. They have a trade off of being light,
          load carrying, and shape adaptable but all three cannot exist at once.
          An example of this is bistable laminates.

          Basics of Bistable Laminates
          <br />

          So, bistable laminates have two stable shapes and consist of thin
          layers of composite materials. The reason that it is bistable is due
          to its geometry as well as residual stresses that occur after
          fabrication. An interesting story is that when i was fabricating these
          laminates :once it comes out of the oven, it is still flat but once
          you remove the fabrication it converts to its bistable shape. On the
          slide here are the two stable shapes of the bistable laminate as well
          as some applications which are daylight control and morphing a car
          fender.

          />

          <br />
          Here are some research questions for you to ponder which correlate to
          the actuation, morphing, as well as the consistency and success of the
          experimental setup.
          <br />
          1. Is there a correlation between actuation time and voltage supplied
          to the mechanism?
          <br />
          2. Where is the ideal spot in the morphing motion to ensure the
          deflection of the particle?
          <br />
          3. Can the mechanism consistently deflect the projectile over time?
          <br />
          4. How successful is the overall setup?
          <br />
          Composite Materials
          <br />
          A composite is where two or more constituent materials of varying
          properties are combined to create a new structural material. By
          utilizing the properties of the individual materials into a composite,
          the structure can become enhanced based on selected individual
          properties. Example : Fiberglass where the resin would be the matrix
          and glass fibers would be the fiber reinforcement.

          <br />
          Makeup of Composite Materials
          <br />
          A composite laminate is similar to a stack of papers but instead of
          paper, we have lamina which is a thin layer or ply of composite
          material. Defined by direction, stacking sequence, and geometry.
          Common in various fields: sports, construction, cars
          <br />
          Bistable Laminates
          <br />
          Snap-through behavior can occur when external forces or moments are
          induced to the laminate at one stable state. Hyer created a system of
          polynomials to determine the shape and other characteristics The
          deformation can be described from these polynomials. Characteristics
          can vary based on: ply amount, ply orientations, edge lengths, shape,
          material properties.

          Piezoelectric Actuators
          <br />
          Electromechanical coupling which means that they will transfer
          electrical energy into mechanical energy or vice versa. First
          engineering application of the piezoelectric effect was a transducer
          which was used to locate submarines Commonly seen in motion and force
          sensors, accelerometers, and actuators. Comprised of rectangular
          piezo-ceramic rods that are wedged between polyimide film, electrodes,
          and structural epoxy. the MFC is used as an actuator then the
          composite can distort materials, counteract and generate vibrations.

          individuals in complex systems. Comprises of Individuals, Population,
          and Generations. Can solve constrained and unconstrained optimization

          Potential Energy of Bistable Laminate and MFC
          <br />
          Up to this point, the equation is based on the laminate stacking
          sequence, material properties, and temperature effects. Integration
          about the x and y edge lengths will turn into a highly non-linear
          polynomial of 15 unknowns.

          Solving Potential Energy
          <br />
          Differentiate the total potential energy with respect to each of the
          unknowns, this gives 15 equations for 15 unknowns
          <img src="sources/diff.png" />

          For solving, these equations were solved in the Python Programming
          Language utilizing the non-linear solvers of the SciPy library.

          <br />
          Evaluating Total Deformation and Transverse Strain
          <br />
          Total Deformation is the out-of-plane (z) distance that the laminate
          traveled. Strain represents a non-dimensional value of the change in
          length over the original length. micrometer per meter (μm/m = 10-6 m/m
          = ppm) is commonly used.

          General Discussion
          <br />
          Rectangular shape did show lower strain than Square which proved
          Murrayw’s results The strain had a different trend than deformation
          Strain and MFC contour results presented large errors Due to the
          non-linear solver being sensitive to initial guess and converges to
          closest minima Optimal Laminate Size too large due to error in
          transverse strain Trimming of the laminate helped offset the error but
          reduces total deformation and increases area covered by MFC Some
          configurations were unable to maintain second shape due to bonding
          issues Despite shortcomings, out-of-plane deformation was still
          experienced This led to a successful deflection event which verifies
          that the structure can be used as a mechanical deterrent

          <br />
          Answering the Research questions
          <br />
          Is there a correlation between actuation time and voltage supplied to
          the mechanism?
          <br />
          The time difference between the start to finish of the patch was
          instantaneous. During the free fall experiment, it took the ball ~400
          ms to hit the laminate but the time delay for actuation to get the
          timing correct was ~200 ms. The remaining 200 ms could answer the
          correlation.
          <br />
          Where is the ideal spot in the morphing motion to ensure the
          deflection of the particle?
          <br />
          This research considered the halfway point of the total deformation to
          be the optimal spot to place the particle. There may be differences in
          the speed of the laminate depending on the shape, layup, and voltage.
          <br />
          Can the mechanism consistently deflect the projectile over time?
          <br />
          The ping-pong ball was dropped repeatedly at a fixed height and
          consistently landed on the surface area of the laminate. The
          deflection experienced on the projectile varies depending on where it
          landed. Some knockback was observed before forcing the ball away.
          <br />
          How successful is the overall setup?
          <br />
          Despite a consistent setup, the actuation either happened too early or
          late. Several tries were made before the structure successfully hit
          the projectile. This could be alleviated with a greater deformation
          range for the particle to fall into before the actuation activates.
          <br />
          Future Research
          <br />
          Computer Vision Methods: Projectile can be tracked regardless of its
          trajectory. With frequent calculations to the time until impact for
          the projectile can increase success rates.
          <br />
          Car Bumper: The bistable laminate could be the bumper of the car and
          if an object comes in contact with it, it can morph at the appropriate
          time to absorb impact. This scenario would save lives due to the
          reduction of impact
