# Hey, I'm Graham

Welcome to my personal website! I hope to use this space to share my projects and technical topics that I've learned over the years. Will mostly be software or mechanical engineering as I am currently exploring all the ways I can use the Rust programming language, and microcontrollers. I enjoy creating new ideas, learning new
skills, and building anything mechanical or programmable. if i'm not
behind my computer, you'll find me walking around the city or bouldering. 


I recently graduated from Clemson University with my Master's
in Mechanical Engineering and currently working for GE Vernova to help develop software (embedded/UI/networking) for custom machines of various manufacturing processes such as Eletrical Discharge Machining and Laser Ablation.

## My Toolkit 

Here's the set of tools that I use regularly or at least try to incorporate them into my projects to deepen my experience and knowledge with them. This section could become its own blogpost or something if i get around to noting down the all the tools and config I use.  

### Neovim 
One of the most helpful editors I have used to tackle navigating and modifying text or code. It's a fork of Vim thats built with the Lua scripting language to have better support for plugins. It does take some to learn the keymaps but once you understand the motions, you will be flying through code and all without touching your mouse.

### Rust Programming Language
Such a great language to use and learn from. I've been exclusively trying to have any new projects be written with Rust to further explore the language. I believe its a language that will last a long time and be compared equally or better to C/C++. Here are some language specific features/tools to look at.  

> Favorite tools

### Ghostty
Quick and feature rich terminal emulator. Loads big files with no problems. I use this with zsh or nushell. 

### Obsidian
Great tool for making notes with Markdown and has plenty of plugins to support your workflow.
### VS Code
Sometimes I'll take a break from Neovim and see what neat features are available on VS Code.

### CLI tools
* ripgrep

### 3D Modeling 
Exploring FreeCAD currently but may adventure on making my own parametric precision 3D modeling tool.
